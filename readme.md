PlaySpent Python Project

This project took me approximately three weeks to finish, from July 3 to 21, 2022.
I used it to help teach myself basic and intermediate Python programming while I am on summer break from university.
It was very challenging and necessitated, on average, a couple hours of work per day, but I feel very proud of my work.
This is my first-ever Python program to be uploaded to GitHub.

The project is a simulation of someone living in poverty who is faced with many random scenarios.
One of the functions randomly selects one of fifty scenario functions for the current setting/mode.

Many of the challenges I faced related to my lack of experience as well as troubleshooting errors 
  and trying to decide the best ways to structure each of my functions.
As such, all interested users are welcome to add new features, change the structure of my code,
  and provide constructive feedback to help me continue to progress in my learning of Python. 
My inspiration for this project came from a browser game known as PlaySpent, and felt like it would
  be reasonably challenging to re-create it in Python using my knowledge of functions and Tkinter.
I acquired much of my TKinter knowledge through the Codemy YouTube channel and encourage 
  everyone interested in learning Python, especially Tkinter, to check out this channel.

I am assigning a GPL license to this project to facilitate expansions and modifications.
